## Overview of the project

## Project : Arduino with LCD and Temperature Sensor
## Components Required:
Arduino (e.g., Uno, Nano)
16x2 LCD with I2C module (or without, if preferred)
Temperature sensor (e.g., LM35, DHT11, or DHT22)
Potentiometer (if not using an I2C module)
Breadboard and jumper wires

## Temperature Sensor:

LM35: Connect VCC to 5V, GND to GND, and OUT to an analog pin (e.g., A0).
DHT11/DHT22: Connect VCC to 5V, GND to GND, and DATA to a digital pin (e.g., D2).
LCD with I2C:

SDA to A4 (Arduino Uno) or appropriate SDA pin on other boards.
SCL to A5 (Arduino Uno) or appropriate SCL pin on other boards.
VCC to 5V.
GND to GND.
LCD without I2C:

RS, E, D4-D7 pins to corresponding Arduino digital pins.
Potentiometer center pin to LCD V0 for contrast adjustment.
